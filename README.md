Differential-Private-Random-Forest
==================================

This is differential private version of Random forest. When any dataset, is used as a training  dataset with this algorithm, 
it will not allow an adversary to disclose the sensitive information from the dataset. 


Copy all these file in your python folder and run the AverageRunner file. Insdtead of "Car" dataset you can use any categorical dataset from UCI Machine Learning Library- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.html.
the output  is the accuracy of our algorithm.
